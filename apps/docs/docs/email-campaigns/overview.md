# Email Campaigns

**Email campaigns** let you reach the people in your [contacts CRM](../contacts/overview.md).
Build an audience, compose a send, and Aglyn handles delivery, caps, and unsubscribes.

**Paid**, with **tiered send caps** — how many emails you can send per period depends on
your plan.
:::

## Send a campaign

1. Build an **audience** — leads, site members, [segments](../contacts/overview.md#segments),
   or an **email list**.
2. Compose the campaign from the **Marketing** page.
3. Send — subject to your plan's **send cap**.

## Email lists

**Lists** are static audiences shared across your organization's sites. Create them on
the Marketing page, then grow them with the **"Enroll in a list"** automation step (e.g.
on form completion) or popup email capture. Target any list from the campaign composer.

## Experiments

Business plans can A/B test screens, sections, and emails from the **Experiments** card
on the Marketing page: weighted variants, deterministic visitor assignment, a conversion
goal, and per-variant exposure/conversion rates with a pick-the-winner flow.

- **Screens & sections** — variants pin a screen *version*; visitors are split
  deterministically and the winning version serves to everyone once you pick it.
  Start a section test straight from the Besigner's Interactions panel.
- **Emails** — variants override the campaign's subject and/or body. Attach a running
  email experiment in the campaign composer; each recipient deterministically receives
  one variant (re-sends reach the same variant), sends count as exposures, and once a
  winner is picked every later send uses the winning copy.

## Opens & clicks

With the Resend webhook configured, campaign history shows **opens and clicks** per
campaign, and clicks on A/B sends count as that variant's **conversions** — so the
experiment results table fills in by itself.

## Compliance

- Every send includes an **unsubscribe** link.
- Unsubscribes are honored automatically so you stay compliant.
