/**
 * Server half of the plugin pattern (AGL-396): the API-route registry, the
 * server counterpart to the ConsoleExtension registry. A feature plugin
 * registers request handlers here from its `/server` entry point (never its
 * client barrel, so firebase-admin and other server-only deps stay out of
 * the browser bundle). The app ships one catch-all dispatcher route per
 * Next app that resolves a request path to a registered handler — so moving
 * a feature's API into its plugin needs no new app route and keeps the same
 * URL. Reference implementation: events-calendar `events/list` (AGL-396).
 *
 * The request/response shapes are structural (not `next` types) so plugins
 * stay framework-light; `NextApiRequest`/`NextApiResponse` satisfy them, so
 * the dispatcher passes Next's objects straight through.
